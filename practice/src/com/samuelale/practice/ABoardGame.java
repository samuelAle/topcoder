 Problem Statement

 Your friends Alice and Bob are playing a board game.
 They have asked you to help them to determine the winner.
 The game is played on a square board with 2N rows and 2N columns.
 The exact rules of the game itself are not important for this problem.
 Once the game is over, each cell of the board is either empty or contains
 a single piece that belongs to either Alice or Bob. You are given board,
 where the j-th character in i-th element (0-based indices) describes the
 contents of the cell in row i, column j: '.' represents an empty cell, 'A'
 a cell with Alice's piece and 'B' a cell with Bob's piece.

 The entire board is divided into N regions.
 Region 1 occupies the 4 central cells of the board.
 Each next region contains all cells that are horizontally,
 vertically or diagonally adjacent to cells of the immediately previous
 region and do not belong to any of the previous regions. For example, when N = 4,
 here is how the regions look:

 44444444
 43333334
 43222234
 43211234
 43211234
 43222234
 43333334
 44444444

 The winner is determined as follows. Consider the lowest numbered region
 that contains a different number of Alice's and Bob's pieces. The player
 who has more pieces in this region is the winner. If all regions contain
 the same number of Alice's and Bob's pieces, the game ends in a draw.

 Return "Alice" if Alice wins the given game,
 "Bob" if Bob wins and "Draw" if the game ends in a draw. Note that return values are case-sensitive.

 Examples
 0)
 {".....A", "......", "..A...", "...B..", "......", "......"}
 Returns: "Alice"
 Both Alice and Bob have 1 piece in region 1, so they are tied there. In region 2, they have no pieces at all, so a tie again. Finally, in region 3 Alice has 1 piece, while Bob has none. So Alice is the winner of this game.
 1)
 {"AAAA", "A.BA", "A..A", "AAAA"}
 Returns: "Bob"
 Even though Alice has 12 pieces and Bob just one, this one piece is enough for him to win.
 2)
 {"..", ".."}
 Returns: "Draw"
 The board can be entirely empty.
 3)
 {"BBB..BAB...B.B", ".AAAAAAAAAAAA.", "AA.AA.AB..A.AB", "..........B.AB", ".A..BBAB.A.BAB", ".AB.B.......A.", ".A..A.AB.A..AB", ".ABAA.BA...BA.", "BAAAB.....ABA.", ".A....B..A..B.", "B...B....B..A.", "BA.B..A.ABA.A.", "BAAAA.AAAAA.A.", "B.B.B.BB.B...."}
 Returns: "Alice"
 4)
 {"..A..AAA..AA", "ABABB..AAAAA", "ABBBBBBBBBA.", "AABBBABABBAA", "...BABABABBA", "B.BA..A.BBA.", "AA.A..B.AB.B", "..BA.B.AABAA", "..ABABBBABA.", ".ABB.BBBBBAA", "ABAAA.AA.A.A", "A..AAA.AAA.A"}
 Returns: "Bob"
 5)
 {"B..ABAABBB", "B.........", "A..A.AA..B", "A.BBBAA..A", "B.AAAAB...", "A..BBBBB.A", "B..ABAABBA", "A......B.B", "B......A.A", "BA.AABBB.A"}
 Returns: "Draw"
